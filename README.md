# PostsHive_PHP
A simple social network built on top of a custom MVC (Model View Controller) framework using Object- Oriented PHP.


In this Project, I build a complete custom MVC (Model View Controller) framework Called PrakashMVC using object oriented PHP. 
This framework is completely open source and you are free to change the name, add stuff, etc and use it as your own. 

This framework will include...

* A core library class to load controllers & methods from the URL (Also using .htaccess)
* A base controller class to load models and views
* A custom database library using PDO for all models to interact with the database using prepared statements

After creating the framework I built an application on top of it called PostsHive which will be somewhat of a social network to share posts. 
This application will include..

* Full user authentication
* Access control for posts
* Server side form validation
* Bootstrap 5 UI
* Posts CRUD
